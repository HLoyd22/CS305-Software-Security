# CS305-Software-Security
---------------------------------------------------------
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
---------------------------------------------------------

I was  tasked with working with a client Artemis Financal. They are a financal consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement,
investments, and insurance to their clients. The company wanted to modernize its operations and implement and applu the most current and effective software security.
They have a public web interface and is seeking my help to protect the clients financal information. They wanted to add a file verification step into their web 
application to endure secure communication, a data verification step in the form of a step check. They would wanted to identify any security vulnerabilities and for 
false positives supress them.

---------------------------------------------------------
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security 
add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
---------------------------------------------------------

Something that I did well in identifying vulnerabilities was the dependecy check. While this may seem like something easy to preform, being able to read and supress 
the false positives is not if you don't know what you are looking for. It is important to secure securely because it helps to mitigate these vulenerablities and the 
risks that are associated with the software development process. 

---------------------------------------------------------
What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
---------------------------------------------------------

The dependecy check tool was helpful because it saved a lot of time in detecting the vulnerabilites automatically instead of habving to manually do it.

---------------------------------------------------------
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine
mitigation techniques?
---------------------------------------------------------

It is important to understand the type of ind t ustry your application will be operating in. In this case, in the financal industy the system will be more prone to attacks. This can be do to the value of the information that is being stored within the system. This will determine the amount of security layers that will needed to be added, the type of those layers and how to implement them.

---------------------------------------------------------
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new
vulnerabilities?
---------------------------------------------------------

Ensuring the application runs properly requires compiling and running the application.

---------------------------------------------------------
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
---------------------------------------------------------

The use of the Dependency Check tool will assist in implementing secure dependencies into a project - or at least the most secure.

---------------------------------------------------------
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular
assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
---------------------------------------------------------

I would be to showcase my ability to understand requirements, assess security vulnerabilities, and implement proper mitigating solutions.
